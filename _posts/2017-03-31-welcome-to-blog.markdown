Hello world! This is my personal blog hosted on GitHub. 

Why GitHub? Well I wanted to blog about my interests in software development, my observations on new software technologies and lessons learned actually coding using these new technologies. So you will see links to the code that I have written (or still writing) as well as links to documents, presentations and articles that I beleive will add value to you the reader. Inclusive of that I want to share my view and experience managing large software products, processes, systems and teams. 

I hope to read your comments on my blog.
